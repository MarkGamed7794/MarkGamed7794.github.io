				Heat waves happen when the air about 4 kilometers up gets put under high pressure (due to temperature, humidity, or otherwise).<br><br>
				This creates a sort of “barrier” which the heat finds hard to escape, trapping all the heat at ground level (which is unfortunately where you are).

				<h1 class="title">How frequently do heat waves happen?</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="info">
				On average, there was about 1 heat wave every 2 years in Ontario, and it’s projected to rise to 3 per year by the 2050s, due to climate change.
				<br><br>
				Heat waves are more likely to happen in arid areas because moisture that is in the ground can lessen the effects of the heat.
				<br><br>
				It is in more likely to happen in it in more of the southern parts of the Canada, with saskatchewan having most heat waves in Canada and nunavut being the lowest

				<h1 class="title">What damage can a heat wave cause?</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="info">
				It can mainly affect the lives of children and the elderly because their bodies can’t control their own temperature very well, leading to heat exhaustion / heat stroke. 
				<br><br>
				Furthermore, it can also cause other effects, like headaches, dehydration, cramps, and rarely, blood clots.

				<h1 class="title">How does climate change impact the severity of Heat waves?</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="info">
				Climate change makes the heat waves hotter due to trapping more heat at the surface. It will also create a better “barrier” for the heat to be trapped by.

				In 2020, the west half of the United States hit a heat wave so severe that the temperature spiked
				by over 10 degrees in some places (e.g. in Seattle, where it hit 38°C at one point). Besides the
				hot temperature effects, the heat wave itself caused a couple deaths, and caused AC units and fans
				to go out of stock almost everywhere. Even worse, some COVID vaccination drives had to be cancelled.<br><br>

				It causes heat exhaustion and heat stroke. It also causes swelling in the lower limbs, heat rashes on the neck, cramps,
				headaches, irritability, lethargy and weakness. The heat additionally causes severe dehydration, acute cerebrovascular
				accidents and it may result in thrombogenesis (or blood clotting).

			</div>
			<p class="info">
				During heat waves the water becomes more hot, the outcome of this is that oxygen levels drop in the water which affects fish
				and marine life, also the water becomes stagnant, this creates a perfect environment for pollutants and bacteria.

			<p class="info">
				Due to the heat, workers are less productive. Around the world 2% of the global working hours are lost every year due to heat. Canada lost 22 million hours of potential labour due to heat in 2020.

				In the 2003 european heat wave 30 000 people died. The high temperature of water and low water levels resulted in French nuclear power facilities shutting down.
