            Curling is a prevalent sport that originated over 200 years ago, and it seems to be the talk of the town nowadays. What caused such a sport to become so popular that people can’t stop talking about it?
            <br><br><br>
            Curling is played with carved circular rocks (called “stones”) slid down an ice rink into a target. Each team has eight stones, and the game is played over a certain number of “ends.” Most of the strategy comes from sliding rocks into the other team’s rocks to score more points, managing to get the right amount of force to slide the rock directly into the middle of the target, and much more. It’s very enjoyable, and it’s encouraged to watch a curling match to see more about the sport.

            The first organized curling club and the first sports club in Canada was the Royal Montreal Curling Club, founded in 1807. At the time, curling was played on a frozen lake using circular stones, and this was the first official curling club. This led to more official sports clubs, eventually into the “Olympic Club,” created in 1842, which inspired the Olympic Games in 1844. At said games, Aboriginals played non-Aboriginals in the very first official public curling match.

            So, after all of that, curling certainly seems like a much more exciting sport than meets the eye.
