            If you’ve been bored in your own home, and want to do something you’ll never forget, then look no further than local activities! Pretty much anything on this list will get you excited to leave the house and finally get some family time together!
            
            <h2>Activity 1: Horse Racing</h2>
            <br><br><br>

            Horse racing is one of the most outstanding activities if you want to make some money. If you’re not enjoying the thrills of racing a horse down a track, why not try your hand at betting? See if you can predict which horse will be faster than the rest, and make some money you can use on anything you’d like! Even if you lose, it’s still great to just watch the horses go down, to cheer them on, and so much more! Definitely see if you can find a track near you; you can’t miss ‘em!

            Curling is a massively popular sport that’s a blast to watch and a blast to play. Just the thrill of seeing the players slide down the ice and always perfectly throw the rocks down the ice is more than fun. Check to see if there are any rinks or lakes near you if you want in on the fun. If you want more info, check out our article about it. (hyperlinked)

            <h2>Activity 3: Pubs</h2>
            <br><br><br>

            If you ever want to hang out for a fun night with friends, look no further than your local pub! Pubs are a great way to socialize with more people than just your friends, even strangers, various activities already there! You can play darts, enjoy some drinks with your friends, and so much more. Pubs are many locations across the province, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding one. It’s great to go there if you invite friends, and it’s highly recommended!
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Activity 4: Travel</h2>
            <br><br><br>
            Why not go for a walk or a river trip and see some beautiful sights away from your area? If you want to see some great landmarks, you should go to Niagara Falls! It’s a great place to hang out, and it’s also such a breathtaking beauty that you could stare at it for hours! There’s also plenty more that we just can’t mention, but don’t forget to check a map or ask someone to give advice on where to go for your next trip!
            <br><br><br>


            <h2>Activity 5: Hunting / Fishing</h2>

            <br><br><br>
            <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NGHIh_TQ9Ig4T2lGuyBv6hQQpbFjsp3WVuB7bYm8BjQI70_8jnwz7sqf-aH2X3uzshrkT9VoDuV1jjeDndOEhZvfWIE_OppQ6s5egBwkYapgqk9fW4vsv5hkpji_6-o2jYUd0mIr" width="30%" class="image-right">

            If you want to really bring home the bacon (both literally and metaphorically), look no further than hunting! It’s a great way to learn some survival tactics and get some fresh meat and skins, which can be sold for money! If you’re not quite into hunting, however, you can always try fishing. It’s a lot simpler and safer, and you can also invite the entire family! It’s a great way to either bond with your family or to earn some cash!

            Of course, there are many more activities than we’ve listed here. Don’t be afraid to ask someone that specializes in this kind of stuff, and don’t be afraid to try something new! We hope you enjoy these activities and become closer with your family or people you know.
