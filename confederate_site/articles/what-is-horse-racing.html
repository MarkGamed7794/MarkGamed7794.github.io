            Horse-Racing. Viewed as the sport of the wealthy, with the traditions of a long and valued history. However, it’s also viewed as shady and associated with gambling. So, which one is it? This article is here to talk about that.<br><br><br>

            <h2>What is Horse-Racing?</h2>
            For those of you who don’t know how Horse-Racing works, here’s the basic summary:
            <ol>
                <li>Find a Horse Race to participate in.</li>
                <li>Place a money bet on one of the horses. Each horse will have a different trainer.</li>
                <li>There are different types of bets with different payouts and different chances of winning.</li>
                <li>If your horse wins, you get a payout.</li>
                <li>You can increase your odds of winning by using various strategies and analyzing each horse.</li>
            </ol>
            Those are just the basic instructions that anyone can follow to get started in the betting side of Horse-Racing. There are also Horse-Racing trainers, who supervise the horses, make sure they get proper nutrition and training, etc. The trainers are the ones who take care of the horses who enter the races. Horse Training is less like a sport, though, and is more of a job which you can get a salary for.<br><br><br>

            The most popular type of Horse-Racing is Thoroughbred Racing, where horses of a special breed race on flat grass or dirt 1km - 2.4 km tracks. All Thoroughbred horses are descended from Arabian, Turkish, and Barbary horses imported into England in the 1600s.<br><br><br>

            A few years ago, in 1860, a Thoroughbred horse race called “The Queen’s Plate” was founded and has run every year since. The first run was on June 27, 1860, at the Carleton racetrack, and it had a prize of 50 guineas. The winner of this first race was named “Don Juan.” If you’re part of the upper class, you may have experienced this race.<br><br><br>

            <h2>Gambling or Sport?</h2>
            So, is Horse-Racing a sport or a way to gamble? The answer is: It’s both. While it’s not a physical sport, Horse-Racing is a sport because it’s a competitive game that was made to entertain, and it requires skill to win. It’s also a way to gamble. This is because although it has many strategies to drastically improve your odds, it’s still at least a little bit luck-based.<br><br><br>

            Some people compare Horse-Racing to Poker. In both of them, the top players will always win more than the unskilled players, but even the most skilled players lose sometimes purely because of luck. So, these two activities are similar. However, most of the time, Horse-Racing strategies are more complex than poker strategies.<br><br><br>

            A better comparison would be with Horse-Racing and short-term investments. Short-term investments could also be considered “gambling,” but investing needs financial knowledge and strategy. With both of these, measuring which company or horse has the highest success chance isn’t always the most important thing. Maximizing return on profit and picking which bets are the best can be more profitable at times.<br><br><br>

            In conclusion, Horse-Racing is both a sport and gambling. It’s similar to short-term investments and Poker. However, Horse-Racing has one thing that Poker and investments don’t; You get the fun and excitement of watching the horses gallop through the fields.
