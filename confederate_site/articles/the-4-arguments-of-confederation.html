            With the idea of Confederation becoming popular, everybody needs to be aware of the benefits. To help you understand the benefits, we interviewed George-Étienne Cartier, whom many of you should recognize.<br><br><br>

            George-Étienne Cartier is the co-premier of The Province of Canada and is a lawyer, rebel, railway promoter, and politician. Ever since he became active in politics in 1841, he has had significant achievements and has positively affected us all. Most importantly, he’s one of the top supporting leaders for the Confederation. He envisioned the result of the confederation; a diverse country from the Atlantic to the Pacific with the creation of a new political nationality.<br><br><br>

            George-Étienne Cartier wants The Province of Canada to split into two separate provinces and have them both join with the other British North American colonies in a Federal Union. Cartier and other pro-confederation leaders in The Province of Canada focused on four main arguments. <br><br><br>

            <h2>Political Deadlock</h2>

            The first one, and arguably the most important, is the political deadlock. <br><br><br>
            <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kQqJ2cYIJ8FIim1erOfH--esRdJkVV_4zKSwBmvcGwcspturowkLh92RqM_BpwksSCJFhTw7Hg7IqvUf8rU1WrlogyHjRh6wBPwiMQ6BILeDWuM4ho2TppCn8D0ZRqNQr-VIx2Lh" width="40%" class="image-right">

            “Every citizen is negatively affected by this. We can barely make any decisions because the French Canadians and English Communities aren’t in agreement,” Cartier told us. <br><br><br>

            This is because the government and opposition have almost the same number of seats, so the government was ground to a halt. <br><br><br>

            “The confederation would solve this, as it would allow us to create a new federal government to make decisions,” Cartier remarked. <br><br><br>

            He believes that any problems created by this new government could be solved much easier than the political deadlock. For example a common concern about the new government is that people would lose power over their own provinces. A solution to this, however, would be allowing each province to make their own local decisions.<br><br><br>

            “Currently, we are in a sea of instability and tension, but Confederation would fix all that,” was Cartier’s final comment on this.<br><br><br>

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WuHzZCLRfotfoquHK7Ppyi5bp_nZ22MjPkpKMgy4P3-yFn9KFyIUG-h1ULNzfQMHhsLycZiXDW1nSFkCJnJ_YuL2X6z3lt3cg5lqrxmUVdttg87JpH-UtH9xJmiGXvKQxEwUYUfs" width="40%" class="image-left">

            The second reason is the economy. British North America is in need of new markets. A confederation of all the colonies would solve this, as it would strengthen the wider economy and grant access to many new markets. Additionally, the Reciprocity treaty was recently canceled, causing British North America to lose a valuable market. However, the Confederation would provide better access to the U.S markets. <br><br><br>

            “A union of the provinces would allow us to break down all trade barriers,” Cartier explained. “and it would allow us to create a strong and stable market of millions. It would allow the colonies to support each other with their resources.” <br><br><br>

            <h2>United States Threats</h2>

            The third reason for Confederation is threats from The United States. Since the end of the civil war, The United States has been angry at Britain for taking a neutral stance.  <br><br><br>
            <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KfjAaepUlKDkLvPE3x51q6vcCDK2xJSv6w5xmuP_ldjBoXawt_GkG2rKkSVMZPCT4uT4b301mDNumAq8m3YxopDmECvJmmMmXeSq8zlN7klDr4uRzlvtHN0_eEtsOtoVKT09YrzN" width="40%" class="image-right">
            “The U.S army could easily dominate our scattered, independent colonies,” Cartier said. “There’s no knowing what the U.S could do. They could attempt to annex our colonies, which they could do easily.” <br><br><br>

            The Confederation was a solution to remove the threats of the United States. <br><br><br>

            “The Confederation would allow us to unite together to defend ourselves. We would not be defending our colonies, but we would be defending Canada as a whole,” Cartier told us.<br><br><br>

            <h2>Transcontinental Railway</h2>
            <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wKfqZgFxUZHfyaOelzs1rFiteNyE2l4j0c7IqmDdfdsQmCp9SKBS4GU1PblAiJGwoBNQdi26DPvbFE1HSQkU6ZhSg_PY-srrhuZgRqAdOVtef1havFz9UafKDH71RXrisCDOSbub" width="40%" class="image-left">
            The final major argument for Confederation in The Province of Canada was that it would allow the federal government to construct a transcontinental railroad. George-Étienne Cartier has stated that he is a major railway supporter. <br><br><br>

            “The railway would allow us to boost the economy and tie the colonies together,” was his main reason for support. <br><br><br>

            Building a railway would support the economic benefits listed in the second reason and would quickly unite our resources and our trade, allowing us to create a strong, interconnected new country.<br><br><br>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            These are the four primary reasons why Cartier and many other leaders support the idea of Confederation. First, the political deadlock, which has affected you all. Second, the economical struggle. Third, the threats from the U.S, and finally, to allow the railway to be built. Will our pro-confederation leaders succeed? The Charlottetown conference has already taken place, and we have convinced The Maritime Colonies to consider the confederation instead of the Maritime Union. Another conference will take place soon to discuss the terms of the confederation. We’ll just have to wait and see.
