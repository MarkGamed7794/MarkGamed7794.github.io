            <b>Responding to:</b> Why are farmers migrating to cities?
        <br><br>
        Hey! I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your article on the farmers migrating to cities. I used to be a farmer, and I didn’t even realize how bad it was here before I read your article. 
        <br><br><br>
        I was constantly struggling for each rent payment, but it became routine for me. After I read your article, though, I decided that enough was enough and that I would move to the city just like all of those other farmers.
        <br><br><br>
        I’m now living in the suburbs, and I’m very happy there! This was definitely the news article that I needed. (And if any farmers are reading this, in my opinion, you should move.)

        <b>Subject:</b> Horse Racing is NOT gambling (and not cruel!)<br>
        <b>Responding to:</b> Horse Racing: Sport or Gamble?
        <br><br>
        Hello, I wanted to share my opinion on the article “Horse Racing: Sport or Gamble?” By the way, I really enjoyed reading the article.
        <br><br><br>
        Personally, I don’t think Horse Racing is gambling. Whenever I’m participating in Horse Races, I usually only bet the minimum possible (usually $1). 
        <br><br><br>
        I think the real fun part about horse racing is the entertainment and thrill that you get when you’re watching the horses race and seeing which one wins! For me, the viewing and planning is bigger than the gambling.
        <br><br><br>
        I’ve also heard a couple people say that it’s cruel. However, I once read somewhere that horses won’t run unless they want to, which means that all of them are basically volunteering to race. I think the horses are actually

        <b>Subject:</b> FINALLY! Please Break the Deadlock!<br>
        <b>Responding to:</b> The 4 Arguments of Confederation - An Interview With Sir George-Étienne Cartier.
        <br><br>
        The political deadlock is TERRIBLE! Please break it! We haven’t had a decision go in favor of Canada East for so long! It’s like our opinions aren’t being heard at all.
        <br><br><br>
        I hope the Confederation can solve this, and that after the Confederation, we can find Win-Win solutions with Canada West.
        <br><br><br>
        In my opinion, this is the most important reason why we should proceed with the Confederation. After all, what good is independence, the economy, railroad, etc. if you can’t govern the province?
        <br><br><br>
        I just wanted to share my perspective. I hope this gives you some food for thought!

        <b>Subject:</b> They want to take away French rights?<br>
        <b>Responding to:</b> Top 3 Reasons Why Confederation Is A Bad Idea
        <br><br>
        I don’t understand why George Brown would want to take away French rights? We’re as much a part of Canada as the people in Canada West. 
        <br><br><br>
        I feel like the French are an important part of The Province of Canada. We’re a big part of the province, its history, culture, etc. If our rights were taken away, all that would disappear, which would be bad for both Canada East and Canada West.
        <br><br><br>
        I hope John A. Macdonald can win the fight to maintain equal representation. This first reason is the most important to me. If Macdonald wins, I’ll probably actually support the Confederation, as I’m sure we can find the right government type and find a Win-Win situation for the Atlantic Colonies.

        <b>Subject:</b> This is Outrageous! How Would Assimilating the French Create a Unified Nation?<br>
        <b>Responding to:</b> Top 3 Reasons Why Confederation Is A Bad Idea
        <br><br>
        These English Politicians are so stupid! Attempting to assimilate the French would only bring negative effects to everybody. The English may have more power, but French Culture is still a huge part of The Province of Canada, and largely helped the province become what it is today.
        <br><br><br>
        Assimilating the French wouldn’t cause a Unified Nation. It would just cause a worse nation. If there are two opposing sides, and one side forces the other side to agree with them, that isn’t unifying them! The French have many good ideas that stem from their culture, too, if only more English Politicians listened to them.
        <br><br><br>
        This big conflict has only caused problems, and I strongly believe that it should be abandoned.
