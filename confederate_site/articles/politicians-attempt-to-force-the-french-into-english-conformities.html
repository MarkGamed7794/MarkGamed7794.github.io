            “If the [Canadiens] are to be ruled to their satisfaction ... every attempt to metamorphose [change] them systematically into English must be abandoned.” - Lord Metcalfe 
            <br><br><br>
            This quote was from Lord Metcalfe, the current Governor-General of the Province of Canada. The quote was taken during an interview about the Province of Canada government’s plan to convert the French-Canadians into English-Canadians and force them to conform to their traditions. Furthermore, they want to remove the French language from the province altogether.

            This decision came to be after around 1800, after the economic crises around that time caused an intense hostility between the English and French population, leading to a shared rivalry for power. However, as the English had more power overall, a plan was created to assimilate the French population into English and force them to conform and create “a unified nation.”

            This decision is being met with a great deal of backlash from both the English and French people. The French don’t believe they should be assimilated, and the English don’t want to create violence between both sides. This might lead to armed conflict, which would considerably harm both sides and lead to the province being weaker in wars.

            However, if this decision were to be canceled, it would undoubtedly be better for everyone, French and English alike. It might lead to the French being generally more accepted and for us to be stronger and more powerful as a combined force. But what do you think? If you have anything to say, be sure to write to a government official or us at East Canadian News to have your say.
