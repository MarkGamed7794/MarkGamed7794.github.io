            Usually, workers don’t become famous. It’s usually businessmen and leaders like John A. Macdonald became well-known. However, this is an exception to that. <br><br><br>

            If you’re a citizen of Canada East, you should’ve heard of Joseph (or Jos) Montferrand. Born in 1802, he was not only a lumberjack but also a strongman and a folk hero. To Canadiens, his fame was only second to The Papineaus.<br><br><br>

            When he was 21, he joined the Hudson’s Bay Company and started working as a logger in 1827, where he worked on the Riviere du Nord and Ottawa River, and he worked in the lumber trade later. He was known to have legendary strength and fought many famous boxers of his time, defeating the Canadian Boxing Champion at age 17.<br><br><br>

            Although this is quite impressive, he was best known for protecting the local Frenchmen from English troublemakers and Irish Immigrants known as Shiners. He was said to have single-handedly defeated 150 Shiners. He’s known to have many more feats of extraordinary strength like these, and he was brave enough to ensure that he avenged the wrongs his fellow citizens were subjected to.<br><br><br>

            While he was in his prime, his reputation was already spreading as a mythical hero, and he gained the nickname “Big Joe Mufferaw.” Many tales were told about him, some exaggerated, but there’s no doubt that he was a strong and courageous man.<br><br><br>

            He retired not so long ago, in 1857, and is reported to have back and joint pains. Although he isn’t strong anymore, his legacy definitely is.<br><br><br>

            Being a folk hero and icon of pop culture would ensure that stories, songs, sculptures, and paintings would be made, and that’s exactly what happened in this case. Over the years, many artists and writers in our middle class made poems, plays, paintings, songs, and sculptures of him. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/O3vIGa7">Here are some examples.</a><br><br><br>
