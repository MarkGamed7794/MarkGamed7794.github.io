            Within the last 60 years, the percentage of people in our colony who are living in cities has more than tripled. Is this because cities are better, or just because people have nowhere else to go?<br><br><br>

            Most Canadiens are farmers. They build their own houses and furniture, with home-grown food and home-made clothes. However, more and more farmers are moving to cities. At the start of 1800, only 5% of people were living in cities. Now, that percentage has risen to over 18%, nearly 1/5th of the population.<br><br><br>

            What caused this spike of people living in cities? First, you need to understand life for these farmers. If you’re a farmer yourself, this should be easy. <br><br><br>

            Farmers rented out land from landlords, such as the Papineaus. However, due to a lack of foresight, many bought the land on credit and could not afford the payments. This resulted in many farmers being in debt. Furthermore, when a farming parent died, the land was split between the children, resulting in the land size per farmer decreasing.<br><br><br>

            So after a couple years of farming, the farmers had huge debts, and their farms could barely support their living. This caused them to find other ways of making money, like in the lumber industry. Some farmers also left to work in the United States.<br><br><br>

            Many farmers were attracted to the bright lights in the cities, and they saw many new opportunities to make money there. So, several farmers decided to migrate to the cities or suburbs when they had to give up their farms or had poor harvests.<br><br>

            One notable farmer who moved to the cities is named Tomas Edwards. He rose from a poor farmer to a wealthy businessman in the cities. “I had a very poor harvest and was full of debt. Then I decided to put my foot down,” he remarked in a recent interview. “. I didn’t want to keep living as a poor farmer, so I decided to move to the cities and start my own business. It wasn’t easy, but it was worth it.”<br><br><br>

            Not all farmers were this fortunate, of course, but this is one of the successful people who moved to the city and went from rags to riches.<br><br><br>

            So, this Canadien migration led to almost 20% of the population living in cities, as opposed to the 5% at the start of the century. They migrated because of their debt and bad situation. But is there a way that people could have solved this flaw in farm life?
