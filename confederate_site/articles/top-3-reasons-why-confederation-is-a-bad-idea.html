            Confederation, the hot topic it is, has its fair share of supporters and deniers. You’ve probably heard arguments on both sides; we’re here to tell you about the top reasons why Confederation is something that will turn out to be a bad idea.

            <h2>1. The French Won’t Have Rights</h2>
            <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xGP7sAhqJbFauVtfK8GS4QfgogH4bLyMUsbGtCKDkrGXeCmFPDrSerKJRuLBZ49qPfxFZ8Rt4E6KNt3WvGFoPTW0nauzTorTmvLDEdYec6F3c9lIYMjN-Xv5g1j1xK8cPEXdGmV8" width="40%" class="image-left">
            George Brown, the Canada West Liberal leader, figures that Confederation would provide the opportunity to assimilate the French-Canadian population and provide equal representation to the British population. Many other people in Canada West also agree. This alone is a bad idea, as it’ll remove a large portion of the history from our own country--the French-Canadian population helped inspire some ideas to the rest of the population, most not even having anything to do with Confederation. 

            However, keep in mind that John A. Macdonald is fighting to ensure that the French keep equal representation. If it pulls through, then Confederation might be a better idea than many people thought. 

            <h2>2. Arguments over government types</h2>
            <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ljio4REu5aa8z2LLRq3WX55p2llmKTsxB2OO9rKwIo5_Y5NNSL_VXVFqO77pW1VCLL7OIULa_fIO6sfYUy1YpWITPN5sDMW6AamrvjyW6E9FZ5ey7N9infj1bEtrHkZgmv3V4hK" width="40%" class="image-right">
            
            There’s been much debate over how the government should work if Confederation were to follow through. The most common argument is whether a legislative or federal union would be better for the population, and some even think that there shouldn’t be a large government at all. 



            A legislative union is when laws and power are all held in one central location. A federal union is when laws and power are spread out between each region, but with a larger government to control everyone, including the smaller governments. Many groups believe that both of these options would cause more problems than they could solve, and that there would be power struggles between the provinces and the federal government. If you perform one idea over the other, remember to mention that to officials to have your say in Confederation.




            <h2>3. It would ruin Atlantic colonies</h2>

            The colonies near or in the Atlantic have very different economic systems (e.g., resource-based, prioritizing fish and livestock vs. currency-based, prioritizing dollars or euros). Confederation would completely change their economy, probably for the worse.
            Newfoundland's economy (and most likely other colonies' economies) is rapidly declining due to the declining fish population and fishing industries. If Confederation were to occur, they'd have to ship goods into inland Canada, and the shipping costs would probably be enough to collapse the economy. Furthermore, the Atlantic colonies are significantly smaller, in population and land area, than that of the Province of Canada, meaning that they would have less power if the confederation took place.

            Considering these points, it’s easy to see why Confederation wouldn’t do any good for Canada, let alone the Atlantic colonies. But, if you have extra reasons for either side, be sure to have your say in Confederation by telling some officials or sending some mail to us, and we might place it on our website!
