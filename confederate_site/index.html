            Within the last 60 years, the percentage of people in our colony who are living in cities has more than tripled. Is this because cities are better, or just because people have nowhere else to go?<br><br><br>

            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/682636238481915942/825054222252507156/emersonnorfolk-tl.jpg?width=981&height=670" width="285px" class="image-left">

            Most Canadiens are farmers. They build their own houses and furniture, with home-grown food and home-made clothes. However, more and more farmers are moving to cities. At the start of 1800, only 5% of people were living in cities. Now, that percentage has risen to over 18%, nearly 1/5th of the population.<br><br><br>

            What caused this spike of people living in cities? First, you need to understand life for these farmers. If you’re a farmer yourself, this should be easy. <br><br><br>

            Farmers rented out land from landlords, such as the Papineaus. However, due to a lack of foresight, many bought the land on credit and could not afford the payments. This resulted in many farmers being in debt. Furthermore, when a farming parent died, the land was split between the children, resulting in the land size per farmer decreasing.<br><br><br>

            So after a couple years of farming, the farmers had huge debts, and their farms could barely support their living. This caused them to find other ways of making money, like in the lumber industry. Some farmers also left to work in the United States.<br><br><br>

            Many farmers were attracted to the bright lights in the cities, and they saw many new opportunities to make money there. So, several farmers decided to migrate to the cities or suburbs when they had to give up their farms or had poor harvests.<br><br>

            One notable farmer who moved to the cities is named Tomas Edwards. He rose from a poor farmer to a wealthy businessman in the cities. “I had a very poor harvest and was full of debt. Then I decided to put my foot down,” he remarked in a recent interview. “. I didn’t want to keep living as a poor farmer, so I decided to move to the cities and start my own business. It wasn’t easy, but it was worth it.”<br><br><br>

            Not all farmers were this fortunate, of course, but this is one of the successful people who moved to the city and went from rags to riches.<br><br><br>

            So, this Canadien migration led to almost 20% of the population living in cities, as opposed to the 5% at the start of the century. They migrated because of their debt and bad situation. But is there a way that people could have solved this flaw in farm life?

Jos Montferrand: The Canadien Folk Hero<br>

Usually, workers don’t become famous. It’s usually businessmen and leaders like George Brown that become well-known. However, this is an exception to that. <br><br><br>

If you’re a citizen of Canada East, you should’ve heard of Joseph (or Jos) Montferrand. Born in 1802, he was not only a lumberjack but also a strongman and a folk hero. To Canadiens, his fame was only second to The Papineaus.<br><br><br>

When he was 21, he joined the Hudson’s Bay Company and started working as a logger in 1827, where he worked on the Riviere du Nord and Ottawa River, and he worked in the lumber trade later. He was known to have legendary strength and fought many famous boxers of his time, defeating the Canadian Boxing Champion at age 17.<br><br><br>

Although this is quite impressive, he was best known for protecting the local Frenchmen from English troublemakers and Irish Immigrants known as Shiners. He was said to have single-handedly defeated 150 Shiners. He’s known to have many more feats of extraordinary strength like these, and he was brave enough to ensure that he avenged the wrongs his fellow citizens were subjected to.<br><br><br>

While he was in his prime, his reputation was already spreading as a mythical hero, and he gained the nickname “Big Joe Mufferaw.” Many tales were told about him, some exaggerated, but there’s no doubt that he was a strong and courageous man.<br><br><br>

He retired not so long ago, in 1857, and is reported to have back and joint pains. Although he isn’t strong anymore, his legacy definitely is.<br><br><br>

Being a folk hero and icon of pop culture would ensure that stories, songs, sculptures, and paintings would be made, and that’s exactly what happened in this case. Over the years, many artists and writers in our middle class made poems, plays, paintings, songs, and sculptures of him. Here are some examples: https://imgur.com/a/O3vIGa7

So, the next time you’re feeling bored, watch a play about Jos Montferrand!
